# System Design

## Design Patterns

- There are common design patterns in software that we can identify and exploit
  - Standard solution to common programming problem
  - Technique for making code more flexible by making it meet certain criteria
  - Design or implementation structure that achieves a particular purpose
  - High-level programming idiom
  - Shorthand for describing certain aspects of program organisation
  - Connections among program components
  - The shape of an object model
- Four essential elements to a design pattern
  - A name the meaningfully refers to the pattern
  - Description of the problem to which the pattern applies
  - Solution describing of the parts of the design
  - A statement of the consequences, results and tradeoffs, of applying the pattern
- Goal of patterns is to have general solution that can be widely applied, utilising others experience in design
- SOLID principles are five principles that improve OOP design
  - Single responsibility
    - Class should be responsible for single piece of functionality
  - Open/closed
    - Open for extension, closed for modification
    - Once classes are complete, should add functionality by extending instead of editing
  - Liskov substitution
    - An object that uses a parent class can use its child classes without knowing
    - Behavioural sub-typing
  - Interface segregation
    - Many specific interfaces are better than a general one
    - No code should depend on methods it does not use
  - Dependency inversion
    - Ensure high level classes do not rely on functions from low level classes
    - Interactions should rely on well-defined interfaces and go from low level to high level

### Creational

- Factories
  - A factory method is a method that manufactures objects of a particular type
  - Constructors are limited, as they only allow objects of particular type
  - Factories can bypass this problem to generate objects of different types
  - Can be used anywhere a constructor can
  - Example - the bike factory that creates bike and all it's dependencies, instead of creating all manually and passing as constructor arguments
  - Cuts down on repeated code
  - Easy to add new variations and scenarios
  - Have to make additional classes
  - Factory linked to class it produces
- Builders
  - Help create complex objects
  - Extract construction into a set of methods, builders
  - Object creation happens in a series of steps, only calling the builders that we need
  - Each sub-step is a different method that could be called by any builder
  - Sub-steps in abstract class builder, then make concrete classes for each type of object we want to make
  - Builders are _not_ factories, they're more flexible versions for complex classes with optional parameters
  - Give more control over construction
  - Can re-use code for different instances
  - Similar to factories, require lots of new classes
  - Code becomes longer, construction still complex but more modular
- Prototypes
  - Make one object, the prototype, then clone it, making copies of itself
  - Putting the responsibility of duplication on the object itself helps us bypass issues around private/public variables
  - Guarantees copy is identical
  - Create a bunch of template objects, then can just clone the ones we want in each situation
  - Don't need more classes just for creating objects
  - Remove heavy initialisation in favour of cloning
  - Circular references can be tricky
  - Might have to perform heavy changes and updates on the cloned object

### Structural

- Proxy patterns
  - May wish to reference an entity without instantiating it
  - Create placeholders for other objects, often by adding another level of indirection
  - Allows us to load on demand
  - Example, image proxy only loads actual image when `draw()` called
  - Uses include
    - Virtual proxy, delay loading of resource until needed (lazy evaluation)
    - Remote proxy, offers client functionality of an object on another server by handling networking
    - Protection proxy, provides access control
    - Logging proxy, keeps track of accesses and requests
    - Caching proxy, saves results of object
    - Smart referencing, if no client is using object it can be removed and then retrieved later (garbage collection)
  - Can hide away parts of the service object so it can be changed or controlled
  - Allows to manage object life cycle
  - Provides availability if service object isn't ready or available
  - New proxies cna be added without changing services or clients
  - More classes so more complexity
  - Adds another step so may result is slowdown
- Decorator pattern
  - Allows to add new behaviour to objects at runtime
  - Wrap original object and add new functionality
  - Alternative to subclassing
  - Inheritance is static, decorator can be done at runtime
    - Pass classes to decorator classes dependant upon what requirements are
  - Can extend behaviour without adding new subclasses
  - Can combine wrappers and make functionality dynamic
  - Removing wrappers is difficult
  - Hard to implement in order-independent way
  - Code can look messy
- Adaptor pattern
  - Adaptors convert data formats we're working with to allow to use other services
  - Instead of rewriting entire code to change data type, just adapt it
    - Add new class that inherits original, but converts types
  - Can do a slightly more complex version
  - Promote single-responsibility principle
  - New adaptors can be introduced without refactoring
  - Depending on code size, converting original object may be cheaper
- Flyweight pattern
  - May have lots of objects that share properties, resulting in duplication of resources and wasting memory
  - Hold one copy of all the properties that objects can then reference
  - Identify resources or data that each object is referencing, then abstract it out to a static class
  - Saves memory when lots of objects are in memory
  - Lots of complexity
  - May introduce additional overhead in compute time - tradeoff

### Behavioural

- Iterator pattern
  - Traverse a container to access elements in order
  - Does not expose container's data structure
  - Allows to abstract traversal algorithms into own class
  - New iterators can be introduced without re-designing existing code
  - Can iterate multiple ways in parallel
  - Not always necessary - do you really need one for a list
  - Can be less effective for highly specialised objects
- Observer pattern
  - Allows an objects dependents to be notified automatically if state changes are made
  - Can work in a push model or pull model
  - Highly customisable, subscribers can be added/removed from what they want to be involved with
  - `Observer` interface has `notify` method
  - Class holds list of observing objects, calls their `notify` method when there is an update
  - Key to many real-time systems and cornerstone of MVC architecture
  - New subscribers can be added without redesigning the publisher
  - Relationships can change at runtime
  - Subscribers notified in random order
- Memento pattern
  - Save and restore objects without revealing details of implementation
  - Make an object responsible for saving its own internal state
  - Can be used to implement undo functionality for restoring state
  - Snapshot implements a limited interface so it can be stored externally (in a caretake object) without exposing internal details
  - Snapshot/memento stores the internal data of object and pointer to original object
  - Caretaker handles restore
  - Can make backups without violating encapsulation
  - Extract out maintenance and resoration, keep original object interface simple
  - Heavy memory cost
  - Need caretakers to track original object life cycles to erase unneeded mementos
- Strategy pattern
  - Select the method to complete a task at runtime
  - Want new object to be responsible for choosing the approach to a particular problem
  - Have a number of classes, multiple strategies, that we can select between
  - Original class becomes a context, doesn't know details of each strategy
  - Route finder has many different strategies for finding routes, by car, by foot, by bus
    - Swap out travel method in route finding class
  - Can swap implementations at runtime
  - Separate details of algorithm from code that uses it
  - Composition replaces inheritance
  - If only a few choices, no need to increase complexity
  - Requires clinets to understand key differences between strategies to select appropriate one

## Architectural Patterns

- Layered architecture structures system into layers that provide services above it
  - More separate a system is, more independent each module is, more can localise changes
  - Each layer relies on layer below and provides services
  - Facilitates incremental design
  - Layers can be replaced to improve or allow multiplatform support
  - Can be developed layer-by-layer
  - Separation of functionality can be hard
  - Can have performance implications
  - Layers depend on all layers below, can have reliability implications
  - Useful when
    - Building on top of existing systems
    - When development is spread accross teams
    - When need to add security at each layer
- Repository architecture has a central repository storing all data in the system
  - Concerned with data sharing rather than structure
  - Have large store of data used by many components
    - Database often passive, access and control done by components
  - All interaction done through repo - subsystems do not interact
  - Components can be independent
  - All data can be managed consistently
  - Efficient means of sharing large amounts of data
  - Single point of failure is bad
  - Can be inefficient to have all requests going through the repository
  - Distributing repository to scale may be difficult as need to maintain consistency in data
  - Useful when
    - System generates large volumes of data needed in persistent storage
    - Data-driven systems where the inclusion of data in the repository triggers an action
- Pipe and filter has discrete processing components that filter data as it flows down a linear pathway (the pipe)
  - Focuses on runtime organisation of the system
  - Each component transforms input data to produce output
  - Flexible - can introduce parallelism and change between batch and item-by-item execution
  - Easy to understand and evolve
  - Matches structure of many apps
  - Supports reuse
  - Flexible
  - Requires standardised data format
    - Modifying standard difficult
  - Useful when data processing
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) focuses on how to interpret user interactions, update data, then present it to user
  - Controller managers user interactions, passes them to view and model to update
  - Model manages data, updates according to operations it is asked to perform
  - View manages how data from model is presented to user
  - Basis of interaction management in many web systems
  - Each logical component deals with different aspect: presentation, interaction, data
  - Data can be changed independently of how it is displayed
  - Allows user to have control over how they see data without changing model
  - Adds additional complexity to design
  - Simple interactions require considering three different system aspects
  - Can be hard to distribute development
  - Portability is low due to heavy interaction
  - Useful when:
    - System offers multiple ways to view and interact with data
      - Good for many types of web and mobile apps
    - Used when future requirements for interaction and presentation of data are unknown
      - Allows for flexibility in view without changing model

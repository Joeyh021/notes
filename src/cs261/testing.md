## Dependability

- Dependability is the trustworthiness of a computer system such that reliance can justifiably be placed in the service it delivers
- It's important that we trust systems as they become more crucial to society and everyday life
  - System failures affect people
  - Users reject unreliable systems
  - System failures are costly
  - Undependable systems cause information loss
- Reliability is a measure of how likely a system is to provide its service for a specified period of time
- _Perceived_ reliability is how reliable the system actually appears to users
  - The two differ because systems may be unreliable in ways users do not see
- There are a number of ways to measure reliability
  - Probability of failure on demand - how likely is it that a request will fail
  - Rate of occurrence of failures - how many failures will we expect to see in a fixed time period
  - Mean time to failure - how long can system run without failing
  - Availability - if a request is made to a system, what is the probability it will be operational
- Attributes of dependability:
  - Availability - likeliness a service is ready for use when invoked
  - Reliability - a measure of how likely system is to provide it's designated service for a specified period of time
  - Safety - extent to which system can operate without causing damage or danger to its environment
  - Confidentiality - don't disclose undue information to unauthorised entities
  - Integrity - capacity of a system to ensure absence of improper alterations with regard to the modification or deletion of information
  - Maintanability - a function of time representing the probability that a failed computer system will be repaird in $t$ time or less
- Some system properties are directly related to dependability:
  - Repairability - how easy is the system to fix when it breaks?
  - Future maintanability - is it economical to add new requirements and keep system relevant?
  - Error tolerance - system must be able to avoid errors when the user inputs data
- A fault is the cause of an error
- An error is the manifestation of a fault
- Failure is the result of an error propagating beyond a system boundary
  - Systems can fail due to hardware/software failure, or operational failure
  - Types of failure include:
    - Hardware failure: Components do not function
    - Software failure: Errors in specification, design or implementation
    - Operational failure: Error between the chair and the keyboard
- Provide dependability by:
  - Fault avoidance - write software to be robust
  - Fault detection and correction - verification and validation processes
  - Fault tolerance - design the system to manage faults
- Dependable processes are designed to produce dependable software
  - Documentable - should have a well-defined model
  - Standardised - should be applicable for many different systems
  - Auditable - should be understandable by other people
  - Diverse - should include redundant and diverse verification techniques
  - Robust - should be able to recover from failures of process activities
- System architectures should also be designed to be dependable
  - Diversity should be created by giving the same problem to different teams
  - Protection systems
    - Specialised system monitors control system, equipment, hardware, environment
    - Takes action if a fault is detected
    - Moves system to safe state once problem detected
  - Self-monitoring architectures
    - Designed to monitor own operation and take action if problem detected
    - Computations carried out in duplicate on separate channels, outputs compared
    - If any difference then failure detected
    - Hardware and software on channels should be diverse
  - N-version programming
    - Multiple software units each made by different teams under same specification
    - Each version executed on separate computers
    - Outputs are compared using a voting system
    - High software cost so used where other dependable systems are impractical

## System Testing

- Testing shows that a program does what it was intended to do
- Highlights defects before a software is in use
- Forms a part of verification and validation
- Demonstrates software meets requirements
- Only shows presence of, not lack of error
- Verification - does a product meet spec?
- Validation - does it meet customer's needs?
- Error - human action that produces incorrect result
- Failure - deviation of software from expectations
- Defects/bugs - manifestation of a software error
- Testing - exercise software to assess if it meets requirements
- Test case - a set of inputs, preconditions and expected outcomes developed to exercise compliance against a specific requirement
- Reliability - probability software will not cause failure for a specified time
- Test plan - record of the application of test cases and rationale
- System testing - covers both functional and non-functional requirements
- Static testing is testing without execution
  - Code review, inspection
  - Works well with pair programming
  - Static testing is verification - does code meet spec?
  - Static code analysis are becoming more common
  - Not limited to code, can also consider documents
  - Should use inspection:
    - Errors interact and hide other errors, inspection can uncover all errors
    - Code does not need to be complete to inspect it
    - Allows to consider code quality too
    - 90% of errors can be found through inspection
- Dynamic testing executes code with given test cases
  - Inspections bad at discovering timing and performance based issues
  - Execute code with given test case
  - Structural/white box testing is test cases derived from control/data flow of system
  - Involves validation - does product meet needs of customer?
  - Functional/black box testing is test cases derived form formal component specification
  - Control flow graph shows all possible cases for program flow
    - Used to reason about test coverage
- Unit tests involve initialising system with inputs and expected output, calling method, then checking the result
  - May use mock objects to make testing faster if objects have heavy dependencies
  - Testing is expensive, should aim to be effective with test cases
  - May miss errors that occur in interactions between objects - integration tests
- Interface errors are the most common in complex systems
  - Interface misuse
  - Interface misunderstanding
  - Timing errors
  - Guidelines for component testing:
    - Check extremes of ranges
    - Test interface culls with null pointers
    - Design tests that cause failure and see how failure handled
    - Stress test
    - Vary order order in which memory is accessed
- Goal of system testing is to check that components are compatible and interact as expected
  - Similar to integration testing but different
  - Check full system including off-the-shelf components and components built by other teams
  - Looking for emergent behaviour
    - The characteristics we only see when components interact
    - Both expected and unexpected
- Test-driven development was originally part of XP but has become more mainstream
  - Tests are developed for a bit of code, write the code so the test passes, move on
  - Writing test first helps clarify and understand functionality
  - Simplifies regression testing, debugging, improves documentation
  - Can be bad if you don't know enough to write the tests, or forget important test cases
  - Most effective when developing new system
  - Does not replace system testing
  - Bad when concurrency involved
- User testing is important, as it tests the system in the actual case it will be used
  - Alpha testing - early version, small group
    - During development
    - Requirements do not reflect all factors
    - Reduces risk of unanticipated changes to software
    - Requires heavy user involvement
  - Beta testing - less early version, larger group
    - Test on version nearly complete
    - Large group of users find potential issues
    - Discovers issues in interaction between system and operating environment
    - Can be a form of marketing
  - Acceptance testing - test release candidate with real people
    - Crucial for custom systems
    - Customers test system with their own data, decide if acceptable
    - Define acceptance criteria
    - Plan the testing
    - Derive the acceptance test cases, covering all requirements (functional and non-functional)
    - Do the tests with the users in a deployment
    - Negotiate tests results with customer, unlikely all will pass
    - Customer either accepts or rejects system
      - Can be accepted conditionally
    - In XP, is no acceptance tests as customer involved throughout
    - Best testers are typical users but can be difficult

## Human-Computer Interaction

- The success of software is determined by the people who use it
- Attention is important, as we have to make use of it to make good UIs
  - Can force or divide attention, or make use of involuntary attention
  - Selective attention is when we focus on a particular stimuli
  - Sustained attention is our ability to focus on a single task for a long period of time
  - Divided attention is our ability to focus on multiple things at once, can depend on how complex tasks are
  - Executive attention is a more organised version of sustained attention, when have a clear goal/plan and keep track of steps
- Memory is important, have to make UIs intuitive and easy to remember
  - Consider the context of the task - how much attention can we afford to give?
  - Three components to memory:
    - Sensory stores - visual and auditory stores hold info before it enters working memory
    - Working memory - short term memory that holds transitory info and makes it available for further processing
      - Decays rapidly and has limited capacity
      - Most key in UI design
    - Long-term memory - holds info for long term storage
      - Episodic memory is knowledge of events and experiences
      - Semantic memory is a record of facts, concepts and skills
  - Decrease cognitive load to make UI sparse and keep as few things as possible in short term memory
- Cognition is the process by which we gain knowledge
- Norman's human action cycle describes the actions people take when interacting with computer systems
  - Steps:
    - Form a goal - user decides what they want to accomplish
    - Intention to act - user makes their intent explicit, considers options they could choose to achieve their goal
    - Planning to act - user chooses an action
    - Execution - user executed the action
    - Feedback - user receives feedback on their action
    - Interpret feedback - user makes their own interpretation of feedback compared to their expectations
    - Evaluate outcome - user determines if they have achieved their goal
  - Gulf of evaluation - the gap which must be crossed to interpret a UI
    - Important to minimise cognitive load so UI is easy to evaluate
  - Gulf of execution - the gap between the user's goals and the means to execute the goals
    - Number of steps it takes to complete an action
    - Should minimise for common tasks
  - Can extract four goals from the cycle:
    - Provide visibility
    - Provide good mappings
    - Provide a good conceptual model
    - Provide feedback
- Gestalt's laws or perceptual organisation are a set of principles around human visual perception
  - Figure ground principle - people tend to segment their vision into the figure and the ground, the figure being the focus
  - Similarity principle - if two things look similar we assume they behave the same way, form informs function
  - Proximity principle - if two objects are close together they must be related, often overrides other visual attributes
  - Common region principle - similar to proximity, if we have objects in a bordered region we assume they are related
  - Continuity principle - objects on a line or curve are perceived as related
  - Closure principle - complex arrangements can be seen as single patterns (eg, the blanks in the shapes showing a tiger)
  - Focal point principle - will be drawn to the most obvious bit of an image first
- Affordances are what an object allows us to do
  - Important to make them as clear as possible to the user
  - Signifiers are cues/hints about an objects affordances
    - ie, a save icon means you can save a file
  - Can be perceptible or invisible
  - Many exist by convention
- Several usability concepts impact system design
  - Feedback - give user visual/auditory feedback on actions performed
  - Constraint - restrain users actions (gaussian blur)
  - Mapping - relationship between controls and their effects (a trash can icon)
  - Consistency - similar operations should use similar elements for similar tasks
- Neilsons usability principles:
  - Visibility of system status
  - Match system and real world - use familiar language to user
  - User control and freedom - give escape routes such as an undo button
  - Consistency and standards (especially consistency in the use of language)
  - Help user recognise and recover from error
  - Error prevention - Are you sure?” dialogue
  - Recognition over recall of action flows
  - Flexibility and efficiency of use - eg, macros for advanced users
  - Aesthetic and minimalist design
  - Provide help and documentation
